    This hello_world example provides you all you need to build a ruby gem library
    while applying skeleton-driven coding with Noe (see http://revision-zero.org/noe)

  # Authors of the project. Each author entry is a Hash and MUST at least have
  # 'name' and 'email' keys. This is used to add meta information to your .gemspec
  # file. Example:
  #
  # authors:
  #  - name:  Bob
  #    email: bob@gmail.com
  #
  authors: []

  # Web links for the project. You should typically include links to the sources
  # (github), rubygems.org, documentation and so on. The first link will be used
  # to fill the .gemspec file. Example:
  #
  # links:
  #   - http://github.com/bob/hello_world
  #   - http://rubygems.org/gems/hello_world
  #
  links: []

  # Gem dependencies. Each entry is a Hash that MUST at least have 'name', 'version'
  # and 'groups' keys. The later is an array of dependency groups and are used to
  # generate Gemfile and .gemspec files. For now, only 'development' and 'runtime'
  # values are supported.

  # Below are defined a certain number of specific variables for the .gemspec file
  # of your library. We'll include it here to keep .gemspec under Noe's control for
  # simple yet flexible cases. If your gem configuration is really specific, you
  # can always maintain the .gemspec manually by setting
  # template-info/manifest/__lower__.gemspec/safe-override to false
  gemspec:
    # Paths in the gem to add to $LOAD_PATH when the gem is activated (required).
    require_paths: [lib]
